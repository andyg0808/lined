Lined
=====

A library for editing line-oriented text files in Ruby

This is the Lined gem. It has been developed to make it easier to read and
write information in line-oriented text files. Originally, I was writing a Chef
config, and, rather than `cat`ing the contents of a file I needed to read a
line from, I decided I wanted a library that would ensure the file had only one
line, as I was expecting. I did not seem to be able to find an existing
solution which supported this, so I wrote one myself.

See the RSpec tests for a demonstration of how to use this gem.
